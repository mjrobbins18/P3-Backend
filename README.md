# P3-Backend

#### Introduction

We decided early on that an NFT Marketplace was the direction we wanted to take our app. In researching our desired functionality we found some sites that we'd like to try and emulate.

##### Technology Used

We built the backend to our NFT Market using Mongo, Mongoose, Express, Bootstrap, and Lodash. 

Some challenges I faced were trying to keep all the moving parts going. I figured that I could leverage some of my past experiences working in project management so I took it upon myself to fill the Project Manager role for our team. I set up hubs to facilitate communication, a kanban board to organize overall project progress, and assisted with back-end development and integration. I primarily collaborated with Naeem on tasks that were within scope, that would contribute to the codebase, and spent a fair amount of my time debugging JSON, routes, and deployment issues. 

The Project 3 - NFT Marketplace was very much a collaborative effort. I was assigned to backend development with Patrick Milligan. The backend development was very much a collaborative effort. I built the framework for NFT assets including models, controllers and organizing the messy JSON from the API. I also began to develop views for the backend until I got my bearing on how the information would flow in the controller. I worked closely with Max Robbins and Omar Abduheh to help integrate controllers in the backend with React. All in all I learned and a lot from this project and enjoyed working with my colleagues.
