# NFT Marketplace -P3

#### Introduction
NFT Marketplace is an app for people to find popular NFT's and NFT collections. Users are able to purchase NFT's and admire them in their Trophy Case. Users can also create their own NFT's and sell them on the Marketplace. This project was created by Naeem Gibson, Omar Abudeh, Patrick Milligan, and Max Robbins.

We decided early on that an NFT Marketplace was the direction we wanted to take our app. In researching our desired functionality we found some sites that we'd like to try and emulate. We were aslo able to find an api directly from OpenSea which informed a lot of our design, but necessitated other technology like bootstrap and lodash.

##### Technology/Methodology Used
<!-- Need input from max abt front end tech -->

We built the backend to our NFT Marketplace using Mongo, Mongoose, Express, Bootstrap, and Lodash. 
We utilized the [Fork and PR](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-712/git-teams#fork-and-pr-workflow/) git workflow and for the most part problems were minimal. Max serves as our git Master and owns the project repos [Backend](https://github.com/mjrobbins18/P3-Backend)/[Frontend](https://github.com/rinkratmilly/P3-Frontend), so it fell to him to merge pull requests. We further divided ownership by function with people choosing to focus on front or back end, as well as ancillary duties. All this helped minimize risks to the project completion and streamline development.

##### Takeaways

'The Project 3 - NFT Marketplace was very much a collaborative effort. I was assigned to backend development with Patrick Milligan. The backend development was very much a collaborative effort. I built the framework for NFT assets including models, controllers and organizing the messy JSON from the API. I also began to develop views for the backend until I got my bearing on how the information would flow in the controller. I worked closely with Max Robbins and Omar Abduheh to help integrate controllers in the backend with React. All in all I learned and a lot from this project and enjoyed working with my colleagues.' -n.gibson

'I found this project especially challenging. From the programming to keeping all the parts in motion it was definitely an experience. I figured I'd leverage past work experience so I filled the Project Manager role on our team. I set up hubs to facilitate communication, a kanban board to organize overall project progress, and assisted with back-end development and integration. I primarily collaborated with Naeem on tasks that were within scope and would contribute to the codebase. I spent a fair amount of my time debugging JSON, routes, and deployment issues. The rest of my time was occupied by reviewing requirements, doc organization, and ensuring deliverables have been met. I definitely have experienced some peaks and valleys and have identified places in my code that I want to revisit, but really enjoyed being able help guide the project and see the functionality improve with each meeting.' -p.milligan

'I worked on developing the front-end functionality for our project with Omar. Together, we worked on styling, functionality, and responsiveness. The biggest hurdle I faced in this project was working with a group as a software engineer for the first time. It was difficult to juggle what little knowledge I have and trying to manage the progress of the project. As far as the project itself, the biggest hurdle was connecting the front-end with the backend and making sure all of our RESTful routes were written and working properly. This has been an amazing experience, and I think that as a whole our group communicated very well and came up with a cool project.'

'one of my biggest challenges was keeeping up with team mates code and getting us in sync by agreeing on names and making them intuitive' - o.abudeh
